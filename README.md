Catalogue Price

The idea behind this code was that to use two prices in this project: price per square foot and price per box. 
Only boxes are sold, but the customer should see the price per square foot, so it is more attractive. 
In Woocommerce by default there is no such option, there can be only one price, so for the catalog page, I entered the catalog price.
